# Supported Synths

This matrix is generated from a single source of truth: `docs/data/supported-synths.yml`.

Status legend:

- `works`: production-ready support
- `beta`: usable, but still needs broad testing
- `alpha`: early support, expect rough edges
- `in progress`: implementation underway and not in regular builds yet

If your synth is in `alpha`/`beta` (or missing), please open an issue with test data and details:
