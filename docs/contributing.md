## Building Your Own Adaptation

To add support for a new synth, copy an existing adaptation close to your target device (manufacturer/family) and adjust the Python implementation for MIDI requests/responses.

Use these guides:

- [Adaptation Programming Guide](./programming-guide.md)
- [Adaptation Testing Guide](./testing-guide.md)

Most new synth support lands through adaptations, so good test data and reproducible steps are the biggest help.

## Contributing Code

- Follow existing project style and structure.
- Include tests when behavior changes.
- Open focused PRs that are easy to review.
