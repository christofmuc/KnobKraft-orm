## New features:

* \#344 Send a message to all connected outputs from the MIDI Log view. This is useful for debugging and quickly checking
response of devices. This is an initial try for this functionality, please feel free to give feedback for more!

## Synths:

* **Yamaha YC series** implemented by @milnak, thanks for the contribution! This adds support for the Yamaha YC61/YC73/YC88.
* **Yamaha reface CP** updated by @milnak.

## Bug fixes:

* Fixed \#355: Creating synth banks with fill didn't work if there were less patches available than required to make a full synth bank. 
Fixed by just repeating the last entry to make sure the entire bank is full.
* Fixed \#354: Deleted user banks are still visible in the UI but gone after restart
* Fixed \#352: The accidental jump back to page 1 on editing a category. This was a regression but introduced with \#310 back in April 2024 with the release of 2.3.0
* Fixed \#353: Renaming a patch would not set the patch to dirty in the synth bank, and therefore sending the changed bank to the synth
did not update that patch, failing to change the name in the synth. There is more to this issue, but the main problem is fixed.
* One more fix for the create bank with fill - don't crash when no patch matches the current filter. Thanks to @salzaverde!
