## Bug fixes:

* \#419 Banks of varying sizes led to incorrect start index when downloading banks. This hit the Waldord Pulse adaptation. 
* Crash on download bank for adaptations which implement the BankDumpCapability but not the BankDumpRequestCapability. This hit the alpha version 
of the Yamaha FS1R adaptation.
