## New features:

* Current patch display now shows two new meta data fields: The program number as calculated for the program, and the size of the patch in bytes.

## Synths:

* Groove Synthesis 3rd Wave now supported and checked that it works.

## Bug fixes:

* \#259 Adaptations would not use numberFromDump() on import from disk. This should be fixed now.
* \#260 Documentation points out how calculateFingerprint() has an effect on renamePatch(), and that both should be implemented
* \#256 Setup is remembered and selected even when the MIDI device right now is not available. Reconnecting will automatically run a retry (once)
