## Bug fixes:

* Hotfix for duplication of patches on flag update. This actually inserted a new item into the import list on every click, the surprise came from the 
hidden side effect of the merge upsert. Furthermore, column names became suddenly ambiguous in certain filter combinations.
* Change of behavior - lists currently can only be sorted by position of patch in list. This doesn't make much sense for import lists, so relaxed that
for now only for imports. Maybe we want to be able to sort other lists as well.
