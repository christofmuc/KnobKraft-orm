## Features:

* **\#389** Removed the special case of the user list save to database button. Now, any change is immediately persisted to the database,
  and there is no undo much like in the rest of the system.

## Bug fixes:

* \#430 Exception on creating new database was fixed. Migrating existing worked, but creating new was broken.
