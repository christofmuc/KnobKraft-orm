## Features:

* **\#306** Allow adaptations to create full bank dumps instead of only program dumps. Implemented this for the Yamaha DX-7, which 
finally has the possibility to upload full banks, and to save banks via the export dialog. Other adaptations can now implement this
capability as well. 
* **\#434** Added clear button to the Keyboard Macro View - you can now remove a macro in case you set it on error.
* Added a new test method to simulate the handshake protocol between the Orm and a Synth, to be able to test full communication
in the adaptation independent of the C++ software. This effectively implements the full Librarian logic from C++ again in Python.

## Synths

* **\#449** Adding in the Yamaha TX81Z adaptation contributed by @summersetter. Thanks for that!
* **\#445** Allow to import categories from the XV-3080 and XV-5080 by extending the mapping_categories.json file as suggested by @summersetter!

## Bug fixes:

* **\#72** Trying to fix the retry bank download problem occuring with the K5000 because the messages are large and there are partial sysex messages incoming.
