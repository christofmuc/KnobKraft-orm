## Bug fixes:

* \#220 Accelerate adaptations by caching fingerprint and name in the C++ code, and only calling renamePatch when the patch extracted is not equal to the new name.

* Fixed crash when selecting a completely empty user bank
* Fixed sorting of user list loaded into Patch Grid - was not sorted by position in list
