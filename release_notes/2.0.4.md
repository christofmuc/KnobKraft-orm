## New features:

* \#250, fixed Python version detection for the build system. Many thanks to @jpursey!
* \#238, completely new way to test Adaptations. I have also written an Adaptation Testing Guide that explains how to hook your adaptation into the generic 
test suite and how to provide test data! Many thanks to @bboc for getting this started and providing valuable input! 


## Synths:

* **Groove Synthesis 3rd Wave** added, given they provide excellent documentation there is a good change that it works out of the box. If not, let me know!  


## Bug fixes:

* \#252 Fixed Virus bank management bug, many thanks to @nezetic for this!
