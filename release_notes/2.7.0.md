## Features:

* \#463 Trying to make the currently selected patch stand out better in the colour grid - using white background and black font now.
* \#461 Alt-Tabbing away did lose current edit of the tree control. This is complex, trying a better handler for now only for the inline editing in the tree control.
You can tab away and back again and the current editor should still be active.
* Updated JUCE to 8.0.8.
* Updated embedded Python to version 3.12.10 for Windows.
* Now building with Visual Studio 2022 instead of discontinued Visual Studio 2019.

## Synths:

* **\#467** **Novation Bass Station II** adaptation provided by @cockroach! Awesomely nice to contribute, and this will be much loved I guess! 
* **\#469** **Behringer Wave** adaptation provided by @willxy! How great to have a second new synth supported by the community!
* **\#465** **Korg microKorg S** adaptation provided by @ilantz! This is a first to have three new adaptations submitted for a single release. My friends, you rock!
