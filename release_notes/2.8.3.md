## Bug fixes:

* **\#504**: Fix user banks created as synth banks by 2.8.x, causing the first save to work and subsequent saves to go into a different list (potentially duplicating the list in that process). Database will
be fixed by 2.8.3, potentially causing duplicate user bank names.
* **\#499** Categories do not refresh when database is changed and that has different categories
* **\#408**: Macro keyboard does not properly allow page transitions forward and backward. Stop hiding patches immediately when hide is clicked because it confuses the macro navigation.
* **\#136**: Generic timeout mechanism by forwarding empty MIDI messages into the callback handler when a timeout has passed. By default, the timeout is 30 seconds in order not to break any existing slow synths, but shorter timeouts can be reported by the adaptations via the messageTimings function. Adaptation Programming Guide was adapted.
* Macro detection is now edge-triggered: The Orm tracks active macro states and only fires when a macro chord transitions from not-matched to matched, preventing repeated triggers while holding the chord and playing/releasing other notes.
* All Notes Off (CC123) is now respected: incoming CC123 clears the internal MidiKeyboardState and resets macro armed states while still forwarding the message to the synth, so held external notes no longer block shortcut detection.
* Setting and clearing the "is regular" flag now got its own macro entry
