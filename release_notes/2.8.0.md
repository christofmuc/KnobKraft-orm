## Features:

* **\#498** Bigggest database change since a long time - backup your databases (Orm will keep a copy before the database migration)! This is to 
store Imports as normal lists just like Banks and User Lists. This allows for better drag and drop interoperability, and will enable important
future features requested, like \#362, different names of patches per bank. 
* **\#468** Adding support for routing all of KnobKraft's output to a secondary device via the Macro setup screen.
* **\#457** Add a third state "regular" to all patches. This can be used to not only mark favorites and hide unwanted patches, but also to flag those
which have already been reviewed and need no further attention. Added appropriate filter button to the search bar and defined the combinatorial 
search filter with all of these possibilities. now.

## Synths:

* **\#495 and \#496** Fixing the Yamaha DX-7II adaptation. Thanks to @AgtSlick for the report and the fix!

## Bug fixes:

* **\#410** When importing a bank via the Import dialog instead of the active bank sync, the bank itself was not refreshed. This was now merged
to be the same operation - either clicking on the "In Synth" bank or use the dialog to select which banks to import, both will produce an import list
and refresh the In Synth bank.
